# R10 React Native App

A React-Native app for both IOS and Android platforms that provides a local developer conference with a user-friendly interface to check out the conference schedule, sessions and code of conduct. Attendees are able read a brief description of each session along with information on the respective presenter. They can then save their preferred sessions into a favorites schedule list. The app also comes with a Map screen to show the location of the conference.

## Personal Learnings

This project provided exposure with using react-native to build an iOS and Android native app in tandem. It practiced the use of React Native's UI components such as View, Text, ScrollView, Image and TouchableOpacity to build up the app's user interface. The Schedule and Faves screens of the app leveraged the use of a SectionList component populated with data fetched using GraphQL. The project also provided the opportunity to become familiar with React Native's debugger for troubleshooting.
