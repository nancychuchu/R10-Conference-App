# R10 React Native App

A React-Native app for both IOS and Android platforms that provides a local developer conference with a user-friendly interface to check out the conference schedule, sessions and code of conduct. Attendees are able read a brief description of each session along with information on the respective presenter. They can then save their preferred sessions into a favorites schedule list. The app also comes with a Map screen to show the location of the conference.

## Personal Learnings

This project provided exposure with using react-native to build an iOS and Android native app in tandem. It practiced the use of React Native's UI components such as <View>, <Text>, <ScrollView> <Image> and <TouchableOpacity> to build up the app's user interface. The Schedule and Faves screens of the app leveraged the use of a <SectionList> component populated with data fetched using GraphQL. The project also provided the opportunity to become familiar with React Native's debugger for troubleshooting.
